                    A university canteen is a central hub where students, faculty, and staff gather to enjoy meals, snacks, and beverages. It offers a wide range of affordable food options, catering to diverse dietary preferences and cultural backgrounds. Beyond being a place to eat, the canteen serves as a social space where students can relax, collaborate, and build connections outside the classroom. Often located at the heart of the campus, it provides a convenient and welcoming environment, making it an essential part of university life. The canteen's lively atmosphere fosters a sense of community and helps create a more vibrant campus experience.
